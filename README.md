# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Story <br>
I wanted to create a daily planner, in order to better manage my time at work.

### Requirements ###
* The current date needs to be displayed at the top of the application.
* The planner includes time blocks for standard business hours.
* Each time block is color coded to indicate if it is in the past(gray), present(red), or future(green).
* The text entered into the text area can be saved, and will persist through page reload.
